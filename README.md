### ***About me***

I am a senior year undergraduate student in the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/), where I am currently being advised by [Prof. Partha Bhattacharya](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/Faculty/telecom-pb). I research at the interaction of 'Applied Mathematics' and 'Optimization Algorithms' that extends to Nanophotonics, Non-linear Optics, Bioinformatics, Biosensors, Brain Computer Interface, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning research.

Currently, I am associated with the [Unconventional Computing Architectures and Technologies (UCAT)](https://ithakkar.engr.uky.edu/students) Laboratory under the supervision of [Prof. Ishan G. Thakkar](https://ithakkar.engr.uky.edu/) at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kentucky, USA. My research at Prof. Thakkar's lab revolves around understanding and characterizing the power handling capabilities of Silicon Microring Resonator-based modulators that are used in photonic integrated circuits employed for high-performance optical telecommunications and computing systems. Furthermore, my research at his lab over the year had yielded a new theoretical framework to simulate the $\chi^{(3)}$ non-linearities in Silicon. 

I am also remotely associated to [BrainSyS LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/brainsyslab/home) under [Prof. Arindam Basu](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/arinbasu.htm) at the City University of HongKong. My research at Prof. Basu's lab revolves on Reinforcement Learning based motor decoding for Intra-Cortical Brain Machine Interfaces.
