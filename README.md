### ***About me***

I am a senior year undergraduate student in the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/), where I am currently being advised by [Prof. Partha Bhattacharya](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/Faculty/telecom-pb). I research at the interaction of 'Applied Mathematics' and 'Optimization Algorithms' that extends to Nanophotonics, Non-linear Optics, Bioinformatics, Biosensors, Brain Computer Interface, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning research.

Currently, I am associated with the [Unconventional Computing Architectures and Technologies (UCAT)](https://ithakkar.engr.uky.edu/students) Laboratory under the supervision of [Prof. Ishan G. Thakkar](https://ithakkar.engr.uky.edu/) at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kentucky, USA. My research at Prof. Thakkar's lab revolves around understanding and characterizing the power handling capabilities of Silicon Microring Resonator-based modulators that are used in photonic integrated circuits employed for high-performance optical telecommunications and computing systems. Furthermore, my research at his lab over the year had yielded a new theoretical framework to simulate the $\chi^{(3)}$ non-linearities in Silicon. 

I am also remotely associated to [BrainSyS LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/brainsyslab/home) under [Prof. Arindam Basu](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/arinbasu.htm) at the City University of HongKong. My research at Prof. Basu's lab revolves on Reinforcement Learning based motor decoding for Intra-Cortical Brain Machine Interfaces. During the summer of 2022, I was also associated to [PEEL LAB](https://sites.google.com/site/plasticoptoelectronicslab/home) under [Prof. Dipti Gupta](https://www.iitb.ac.in/mems/en/prof-dipti-gupta-0) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My research at PEEL LAB involved developing a multi-layered PCB using off-shelf components for continuous Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. 

Previously, during summer 2021 I was elected as an [Indian Academy of Sciences (IASc) Summer Research Fellow](https://webjapps.ias.ac.in/fellowship2021/lists/selectedList.jsp) to research at [Prof. Sukhdev Roy's](https://www.dei.ac.in/dei/science/index.php/phy-faculty/90-physicsfaculty/130-dr-sukhdev-roy) lab at DayalBagh Educational Insitute, India.
