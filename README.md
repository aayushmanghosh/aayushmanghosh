### ***About me***

I am a first year PhD student at [UIUC-ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/) and [H-MNTL](https://mntl.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Lynford L. Goddard](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/lgoddard). My research focuses on exploring nonlinear and Quantum optical properties with subsurface controllable refractive index via beam exposure (SCRIBE) method, a lithographic approach that enables the tuning of the refractive index inside photoresist-filled nanoporous silicon and silica scaffolds. 

Before my doctoral studies, I obtained my B.S. from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/), where I was advised by [Prof. Partha Bhattacharya](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/Faculty/telecom-pb). During my undergraduate days, I had a 'half-blood' training, which means that I was conventionally trained as an engineer but researched in various directions concerning Physics and Mathematics. My research focus at that time involved the interaction between 'Statistical Learning' and 'Physics', which extended to Non-linear Optics, Quantum Optics, Brain Computer Interface, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I was fortunate enough to intern at the [UCAT LAB](https://ithakkar.engr.uky.edu/students) under the supervision of [Prof. Ishan G. Thakkar](https://ithakkar.engr.uky.edu/) at University of Kentucky. My research there took a turn from conventional non-linear optics to understanding and characterizing the power handling capabilities of Silicon Microring Resonator-based modulators used in photonic integrated circuits. Throughout the last two years of my bachelor's, I was also remotely associated to [BrainSyS LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/brainsyslab/home) under [Prof. Arindam Basu](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/arinbasu.htm) at the City University of HongKong. My research at Prof. Basu's lab fueled my interest in Statistical Learning. I worked on developing Reinforcement Learning based motor decoders for Intra-Cortical Brain Machine Interfaces. Other than this, I held numerorus other appointments, which included the PEEL LAB at [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), SPIRE LAB at [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/) and [Prof. Sukhdev Roy's Lab](https://www.dei.ac.in/dei/science/index.php/phy-faculty/90-physicsfaculty/130-dr-sukhdev-roy) at DEI. During my time at Prof. Roy's lab I was supported by the [Indian Academy of Sciences (IASc) Summer Research Fellowship](https://webjapps.ias.ac.in/fellowship2021/lists/selectedList.jsp)

I was also remotely engaged in few research collabortions and projects over the past three years mostly in the feild of statistical learning with implications in bioinformatics, and medical image segmentation. I am grateful to my list of collaborators: [Sayan Sarkar](https://ipel.home.ece.ust.hk/people/ssarkar.html), HKUST; [Dr. Peter Charlton](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/pcu-group/researchers/peter-charlton/), University of Cambridge; and [Dr. Haipeng Liu](https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/haipeng-liu), Coventry University, UK.
