### ***About me***

I am a first year PhD student at [UIUC-ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/) and [H-MNTL](https://mntl.illinois.edu/), advised by [Prof. Lynford L. Goddard](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/lgoddard). My research focuses on exploring and observing nonlinear and Quantum optical capabilities of volumetric optical devices, fabricated using subsurface controllable refractive index via beam exposure (SCRIBE) method, a lithographic approach that enables the tuning of the refractive index inside photoresist-filled nanoporous silicon and silica scaffolds. 

Before starting my doctoral studies, I obtained my B.S. from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/), where I was advised by [Prof. Partha Bhattacharya](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/Faculty/telecom-pb). Throughout my undergraduate studies, I researched in various directions concerning Optical Physics, Mathematics and Engineering. During the period of 2021 to 2023 summer, I was remotely associated with the [UCAT LAB](https://ithakkar.engr.uky.edu/students) under the supervision of [Prof. Ishan G. Thakkar](https://ithakkar.engr.uky.edu/) at the University of Kentucky. I researched on understanding and characterizing the power handling capabilities of Silicon Microring Resonator-based electr-optic modulators used in photonic integrated circuits. I performed numerical simulations, which suggested that the fabrication impurities also had a greater role in modulating the power handling capabilities. During the same timeframe, I was also remotely associated to [BrainSyS LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/brainsyslab/home) under [Prof. Arindam Basu](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/arinbasu.htm) at the City University of HongKong. I worked on developing lightweight, online reinforcement learning based motor decoders for Intra-Cortical Brain Machine Interfaces. Other than this, I held numerorus other appointments, which included brief visits at the PEEL LAB, [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), SPIRE LAB at [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/) and [Prof. Sukhdev Roy's Lab](https://www.dei.ac.in/dei/science/index.php/phy-faculty/90-physicsfaculty/130-dr-sukhdev-roy) at DEI, Agra. My visits were all sponsored/supported by the faculty or [Indian Academy of Sciences (IASc) Summer Research Fellowship](https://webjapps.ias.ac.in/fellowship2021/lists/selectedList.jsp)

For the longest duration in my undergrad, I also engaged in research collabortions and projects mostly in the feild of statistical learning with implications in bioinformatics, and medical image segmentation. I am grateful to my list of collaborators: [Sayan Sarkar](https://ipel.home.ece.ust.hk/people/ssarkar.html), HKUST; [Dr. Peter Charlton](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/pcu-group/researchers/peter-charlton/), University of Cambridge; and [Dr. Haipeng Liu](https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/haipeng-liu), Coventry University, UK.
