### ***About me***

I am a senior year undergraduate student in the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/), where I am currently being advised by [Prof. Partha Bhattacharya](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/Faculty/telecom-pb). I research at the interaction of 'Applied Mathematics' and 'Optimization Algorithms' that extends to Nanophotonics, Non-linear Optics, Bioinformatics, Biosensors, Brain Computer Interface, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning research.

Currently, I am associated with the [Unconventional Computing Architectures and Technologies (UCAT)](https://ithakkar.engr.uky.edu/students) Laboratory under the supervision of [Prof. Ishan G. Thakkar](https://ithakkar.engr.uky.edu/) at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kentucky, USA. My research at Prof. Thakkar's lab revolves around understanding and characterizing the power handling capabilities of Silicon Microring Resonator-based modulators that are used in photonic integrated circuits employed for high-performance optical telecommunications and computing systems. Furthermore, my research at his lab over the year had yielded a new theoretical framework to simulate the $\chi^{(3)}$ non-linearities in Silicon. 

I am also remotely associated to [BrainSyS LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/brainsyslab/home) under [Prof. Arindam Basu](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/arinbasu.htm) at the City University of HongKong. My research at Prof. Basu's lab revolves on Reinforcement Learning based motor decoding for Intra-Cortical Brain Machine Interfaces. During the summer of 2022, I was also associated to [PEEL LAB](https://sites.google.com/site/plasticoptoelectronicslab/home) under [Prof. Dipti Gupta](https://www.iitb.ac.in/mems/en/prof-dipti-gupta-0) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My research at PEEL LAB involved developing a multi-layered PCB using off-shelf components for continuous Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. 

Previously, during late summer 2021 I was elected as an [Indian Academy of Sciences (IASc) Summer Research Fellow](https://webjapps.ias.ac.in/fellowship2021/lists/selectedList.jsp) to research at [Prof. Sukhdev Roy's](https://www.dei.ac.in/dei/science/index.php/phy-faculty/90-physicsfaculty/130-dr-sukhdev-roy) lab at DayalBagh Educational Insitute, India. I worked on developing ultrafast all-optical low-power computing circuits using Silicon Microring Resonators. I used time-domain coupled mode theory (CMT) to further simulate the all-optical networks. Prior to that, I was working with the [SPIRE LAB](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spire-lab/?originalSubdomain=in) under [Prof. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh's](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/~prasantg/) guidance at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. My research at Prof. Ghosh's lab was on neurodegenerative disease classification from speech segments using DL algorithms. 

Other than my Professional commitments, I am also engaged in few unofficial research collabortions and projects over the past three years. I collaborate with final year PhD student at HKUST, [Sayan Sarkar](https://ipel.home.ece.ust.hk/people/ssarkar.html) to understand the significance of cardiovascular (ECG, PPG, ABP) signal in non-invasive Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation. To further progress our research directions in understanding PPG signal, we are in active collaboration with [Dr. Peter Charlton, University of Cambridge](https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/people/pcu-group/researchers/peter-charlton/); [Dr. Haipeng Liu, Coventry University, UK](https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/haipeng-liu); [Prof. Amir M. Rahmani, University of California, Irvine](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~amirr1/), and [Dr. Iman Azimi, University of Turku, Finland](https://users.utu.fi/imaazi/).
